        <p> Melnik is located in the southwestern part of the country in the Blagoevgrad province in the southwestern Pirin Mountains. The town is an architectural reserve and 96 of its buildings are cultural monuments. With a population of 385, it is the
            smallest town in Bulgaria, retaining its city status today because more than half of its residents work in the tourist business.

            The biggest attraction of this town are its buildings, the stunning sand pyriamids that suround it and last but not least the long history of wine making dating back to 1346. The local wine from the varietal Broad Leave Melnik Vine was reportedly a favourite
            of Winston Churchill's.

            Interesting architectural landmarks include the Byzantine House, one of the oldest civilian buildings in the Balkans (built probably in the 12th or 13th century as a Bulgarian fortress), the Kordopulov House (named after the merchant Manolis Kordopulou
            to whom it once belonged), which also has one of the largest wine cellars in Melnik, the Pashov House (1815), which houses the Historical Museum of Melnik and the Pasha's House, built by Ibrahim Bey, one of the richest beys in the region,
            during Ottoman rule.
